# Retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG-


## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that enhances the performance of language models by incorporating external knowledge bases or document stores. RAG combines two main components: Retrieval and Generation, to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## How RAG Works

1. **Input Query**: A user provides an input query or question.
2. **Document Retrieval**: The retrieval component searches a large corpus or knowledge base to find the most relevant documents or passages related to the query.
3. **Contextual Generation**: The generation component uses both the input query and the retrieved documents to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response.
